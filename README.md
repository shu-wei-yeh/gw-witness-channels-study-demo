# gw-witness-channels-study-demo
This repository provides foundational materials for studying gravitational wave (GW) strain data and witness channels from GW detectors, particularly LIGO (H1/L1) and KAGRA (K1). It includes notebooks for:

- Checking the Amplitude Spectral Density (ASD) of GW strain channels and witness channels.
- Tracking the maximum values of witness channels over time within the specified frequency range.
- Calculating and displaying coherence between GW strain and witness channels at the target noise frequencies of interest.
